# GeoCache

#### An Epicodus Independent Project JavaScript week #4

#### By Joe Parsley

## Description

* This is a project demonstrating my ability with the angular CLI after just two weeks of exposure. Here's what I came up with!

## User Story:

* As a user, I want to be able to add to the site a new geocache that I have hidden. I want to be able to add it by either physical address or GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude). I should also be able to add myself as the creator of this geocache.

* As a user, I want to be able to view a listing of all geocaches that have been added to the site.

  `$ bower install`

  This will download the project's dependencies

  * Within the src folder create a file in the app directory called `api-keys.ts`

    Copy and Paste this code to the file

    `export var masterFirebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "AIzaSyBJ4IULxWHBjLuKcB5vZY19uLQxvUbo1ug",

      };
  `

* Build the project,

  Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

* Run the server,

  Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
